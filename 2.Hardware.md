## -The Modern Computer

### Introduction to Computer Hardware

- Ports are connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer
- CPU is the brain of our computer. The CPU does all the calculations and data processing.
- RAM is the computerâ€™s short-term memory, It is used to store temporary data. eg) typing chats or words in a word processor
- Hard Drive holds all our data, which includes all of our music, pictures, and applications.
- Motherboards is the body or circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces
- Programs are instructions that tell the computer what to do
- EDB(External Data Bus) is a row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer

### CPU and Cache

- Cache is a small, fast storage area that keeps recently accessed data. It plays a crucial role in speeding up data access by storing a local copy of frequently used data, avoiding the need to traverse the entire data path involving various hardware and software components.

### CPU Cache Levels

- **Level 3 (L3) Cache**: This is the largest and slowest cache level but still faster than RAM. It's often shared across all CPU cores.
- **Level 2 (L2) Cache**: Faster and smaller than L3, it holds data not currently being used by the CPU. Each core typically has its own L2 cache.
- **Level 1 (L1) Cache**: The fastest and smallest cache, holding data currently in use by the CPU. Each core usually has its own L1 cache.

### Overclocking CPUs

- Overclocking involves running a CPU at a higher frequency than its factory setting to enhance performance, beneficial for tasks like video editing or gaming. However, it poses risks such as overheating, system failure, reduced lifespan, and voided warranties. Key variables in overclocking include the base CPU clock frequency, core frequency (base frequency multiplied by core multipliers), and core voltage adjustments.

### Safe Overclocking Practices

To safely overclock a CPU, one must:

- Ensure the CPU and motherboard support overclocking.
- Clean the computer and ensure proper cooling, preferably with advanced cooling systems over stock coolers.
- Follow manufacturer guidelines for overclocking, including using benchmarking software for baseline performance, adjusting core multipliers, and carefully increasing voltage without exceeding 1.4V without specialized cooling.
- It is important to understand the risks associated with overclocking and suggest that purchasing a CPU with the required speed is often a safer and more reliable option.
