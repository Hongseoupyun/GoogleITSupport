# 1.Introduction to IT (MODULE 1)

## -Introduction to IT Support

### What is IT?

- IT is about people; IT helps people solve meaningful problems by using technology

### What does an IT Support Specialist do?

- No such thing as day to day work
- Managing, Installing, Maintaining, Troubleshooting, Configuring Office and Computing Equipment

## -History of Computer

### The Path to Modern Computer

- Computer is to perform calculation
- Computer in early age; Abacus→ Punch card → Vacuum Tubes → Smaller Computers → Laptops → SmartPhones
- The use of Transistors to control electrical voltages made computers more compact and efficient
- Computer became more compact and widely used as time goes. Computer was really expensive for average small family to buy and use it. It was used in Governments, Military etc.
- Steve Wozniak invented Apple 1 (Single Board Computer) → Average consumers/Families started using computers(Apple 2)
- 1980s, IBM invented personal computers with MS DOS (Microsoft Disc Operating System) and Microsoft Windows’s GUI helped normal people to use computers in home and office
- ATARI brings personal computers for gaming to home
- NOKIA PDA(Personal Digital Assistant)
- Now SmartPhones!!!

## -Digital Logic

### Computer Language

- A computer uses ones and zeros to calculate and communicate
- A computer groups binary into 8 numbers or **bits**
- A group of 8bits is referred to **byte**

### Character Encoding

- ASC
- UTF-8; UTF-8 can store a character in more than one byte.

### Binary

- By translating the combinations of Zeros and ones, Computer can calculate
- If there is electricity voltage via transistor, We would denote it as one. Otherwise, It is zero
- Just a Transistor is not enough to do a complex tasks. We have a Logic gate instead

- Knowing how logic gates work is important to understanding how a computer works. Computers work by performing binary calculations. **Logic gates** are electrical components that tell a computer how to perform binary calculations.

## -Computer Architecture Layer

### Abstraction

- Abstraction is to take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use, in other words, Abstraction hides complexity by providing a common interface.
- We have computers, mouse etc instead of Steering wheels and Pedals etc.
- An error message is another example of abstraction in the computing world, It tells you what is wrong instead of telling you what is wrong and what bugs reside in someone else’s code and system
- A good example of Abstraction is driving a car, there are transmissions and engines under the hood to move the car. You do not have to know how to operate transmissions and engines directly but you have a steering wheel and pedal to operate a car.

### 4 Layers of Computer

- Hardware; Laptops, Keyboards, Mouse etc
- Operating System; allows hardware to communicate with the system
- Software
- Users
